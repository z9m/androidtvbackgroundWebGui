# TV Background Suite & Web Editor

**TV Background Suite** is a powerful, web-based tool designed to generate high-quality, customized background images and posters for media servers like **Jellyfin**, **Emby**, and **Plex**, or for use with Android TV launchers.

It features a full WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You Get) editor allowing you to add metadata, ratings, and apply advanced texture effects to text.

## ✨ Features

- **Web-Based Editor:** Create layouts visually in your browser. Drag, drop, and customize text and images.
- **Media Server Integration:** Connects directly to **Jellyfin**, **Plex**, **Radarr**, **Sonarr**, **Trakt**, and **TMDB** to fetch metadata and artwork automatically. *(Note: Currently, only **Jellyfin** has been successfully tested.)*
- **Texture Manager:** Apply "Magic Textures" (e.g., Gold, Silver, Grunge) to your text for a premium look.
- **Overlay Manager:** Easily upload and place guide overlays(you need a launcher screenshot with transparent background).
- **Font Manager:** Upload and use your own `.ttf` or `.otf` fonts.
- **Batch Processing:** Automate the generation of backgrounds for entire libraries or collections.
- **Responsive Design:** Works on Desktop and Mobile devices.
- **Docker Ready:** Easy deployment on NAS systems like Unraid, TrueNAS, or Synology.

## 🗺️ Roadmap

- **Android TV App:** A dedicated Android TV application is planned to automatically fetch and rotate these backgrounds directly on your device.

## 🚀 Installation (Docker)

The easiest way to run the application is via Docker.

### Docker Compose (Recommended)

Create a `docker-compose.yml` file:

```yaml
version: '3.8'

services:
  tv-background:
    image: your-dockerhub-username/tv-background-suite:latest
    container_name: tv-background-editor
    ports:
      - "5000:5000"
    volumes:
      - ./config.json:/app/config.json
      - ./layouts:/app/layouts
      - ./overlays:/app/overlays
      - ./textures:/app/textures
      - ./fonts:/app/fonts
      - ./output:/app/editor_backgrounds
    restart: unless-stopped
```

Run the container:
```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

Access the editor at: `http://YOUR_SERVER_IP:5000/editor`

### Docker Run

```bash
docker run -d \
  --name=tv-background-editor \
  -p 5000:5000 \
  -v /path/to/config.json:/app/config.json \
  -v /path/to/output:/app/editor_backgrounds \
  your-dockerhub-username/tv-background-suite:latest
```

## 📂 Configuration & Volumes

To persist your data and access generated images, map the following volumes:

| Container Path | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `/app/config.json` | Stores API keys, URLs, and general settings. |
| `/app/layouts` | Stores your saved design layouts (`.json`). |
| `/app/overlays` | Folder for custom overlay images (PNG). |
| `/app/textures` | Folder for text texture patterns (JPG/PNG). |
| `/app/fonts` | Folder for custom fonts (`.ttf`, `.otf`). |
| `/app/editor_backgrounds` | **Output:** Images generated by the Web Editor.

### Networking (DNS)
If you are running this in Docker and trying to connect to a local media server (e.g., on the same NAS) using a hostname like `http://truenas:8096`, the container might not resolve the name.

**Option 1 (Use IP):** Use the IP address of your server in the settings (e.g., `http://192.168.1.50:8096`).

**Option 2 (Use host.docker.internal):**
Add this to your `docker-compose.yml`:
```yaml
    extra_hosts:
      - "host.docker.internal:host-gateway"
```
Then, in the editor settings, use `http://host.docker.internal:8096` as the URL.

**Option 3 (Map Hostname):**
If you prefer to use your NAS hostname (e.g., `truenas`), map it manually:
```yaml
    extra_hosts:
      - "truenas:192.168.1.100"
```

## 🛠️ Usage

1.  **Provider Settings:**
    Go to the **Settings** tab. Enter your URL and API Keys for Jellyfin, Plex, or TMDB. Use the "Test Connection" buttons to verify connectivity.
    
2.  **Layout Editor:**
    - Use **Shuffle Preview** to load random media from your connected services.
    - Adjust text alignment, colors, and fonts.
    - Apply **Textures** to text for artistic effects.
    - Add **Metadata Tags** (Rating, Year, Runtime) dynamically.

3.  **Batch Processing:**
    Go to the **Batch Processing** tab to generate backgrounds for your entire library automatically based on your selected layout.
